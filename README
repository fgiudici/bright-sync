-- BRIGHTNESS SYNC --

-- INTRO --
This software has been written in order to synchronize Sony Y series laptop
brightness raw control with the one updated by gnome.
It could be used for other laptop models too, it should work if these
conditions are true:
1)	when you try to change brightness, file:
	/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video1/brightness
	is changed, but nothing happens to your screen.
2)	you have a raw brightness control, e.g., something like:
	/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
	and changing its value actually changes your screen brightness.

It works simply monitoring changes on the input directory, and when a change
is detected, output directory is updated accordingly.


-- COMPILING --
You should just issue a "make" on the main directory in order to compile
Brightness Sync. You will find the binary "bsync" in the "bin" directory.


-- INSTALLING --
In order to let bsync start automatically on your system at boot, add it
to your rc.local file (/etc/rc.local) before the "exit 0" statement.

In order to let it work after standby or hibernation, you need to add a file
under your /etc/pm/sleep.d/ directory (root access required). You will find a
sample script file under the "script" directory (remember to change the path
of the bsync binary with the one where you have put yours).
